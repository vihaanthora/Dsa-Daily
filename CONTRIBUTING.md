## How to Contribute
### 1. Pick an issue to fix
The best way to start with the main code base is to fix some existing bugs. Peruse the Easy to fix issues in the issue tracker and see if one interests you. If you'd like to try to fix it, then create a message in the issue saying that you'd like to work on it. If it isn't clear how to fix it, ask for suggestions on how to do it in the issue itself, on the mailing list, or on Gitter sympy/sympy.

SymPy's code is organized into Python packages and modules. The core code is in the sympy/core directory and other packages in the sympy directory have more specific code, for example sympy/printing handles how SymPy objects are printed to the terminal, in IPython notebooks, or in our web applications.

If you are looking for a somewhat larger project to implement, check out the Project General Ideas page. This page is a collection of projects that contributors have come up with but have not yet had the time or opportunity to implement themselves.

Create an issue if there isn't one for what you want to do.

### 2. Create a new branch.
### 3. Modify code and/or create tests of it.
### 5. Only then commit the changes.
### 7. Create a patch file or pull request for GitHub
